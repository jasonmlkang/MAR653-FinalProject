## Project Report

The project report should contain the following:

- Executive summary
- Research objective
- Research plan and methodology
- Data findings
- Conclusion
- Recommendations

Use the above as appropriate headings for each section of the **paper**.

You will present your project results during the week 10 live session. Your
presentation deck will also be your project report. You can submit additional
appendices with the presentation deck as part of your project report. I will,
however, place more importance on the presentation deck when evaluating the
report.

## Project Evaluation

Your project score will be determined by the team’s final report, the team’s
presentation in class, and a team peer evaluation.

Feel free to review past projects (these will be posted) for some examples.
Some past research questions used have been:

1. Revenue of a property on Airbnb using the available data?
1. How does review sentiment affect a property’s potential to be rented on Airbnb?
1. What are the drivers of Airbnb property revenues in Miami and Paris?
1. How would you optimize Airbnb property revenues in Miami and Paris? Are your
   strategies different or the same in these cities?
